This is a website I created to honor the work of my father. The site is my first attempt to use [Gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). It was created completely from scratch as I did not find any template I like.

So far, I am happy with the result - for sure there are improvements possible and further extensions (example: to create different language versions of the site - right now it is however possible to translate the site to any language via a webbrowser directly).

Site address is: [www.jozefpodprocky.sk](https://www.jozefpodprocky.sk)
